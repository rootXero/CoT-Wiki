# Set Dressing
Please make your own level and keep everything in your own level. Label it lvl1_set_YourName

Here is where you're going to find details on Set dressing including the file structure, room assignments and what to place in each room. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE ROOM CRITERIA! Keep in mind, when you have Blue Printed Treasure you DO NOT NEED TO ADD ANY VALUES YET. This will be discussed further.
1. Ctrl+M will move selected meshes into highlighted levels.
1. Alt+Shift will duplicate and move the camera with asset
1. FOLLOW THE FOLDER STRUCTURE
1. Keep an eye on the treasure chests used, don't put something that originally belonged in level one in the cave areas.

If you have any questions, contact Jess or Ash

# Treasure and Scrap Piles
1. TREASURE has gold particles off of them
1. SCRAP has purple particles off of them

## Placement (Piles)

There is a line of treasure at spawn in their respective folders. Alt + drag these (as you would duplicate) into your room and then into your level and dress from there. 

1. DO make sure that these are moved into your level.
1. DO NOT remove these from their folder.
1. DO NOT move the original groups.

## Placement (Individual)
Follow Pickup_BP directions in wiki.

## Set Before Play 

Make sure you fill in the value for Treasure or Scrap, these should be the ONLY adjustments you have to make. See the Pick Up BP Wiki SET BEFORE PLAY


# Treasure and Scrap Allotment

Please populate treasure liberally, but symmetrically. This means that you should feel free to give the player LOADS of treasure--big numbers feel good!--but make sure that in every given possible route through an area (on every set of scaffolding, in every disparate tunnel, etc.) there is a roughly equal amount of treasure to be nabbed, for fairness.

Individual, nonunique items should have between 50-199 treasure points attached to them. Individual, UNIQUE items, such as the assets Ben made for L3 initially, can be left up to set dresser jurisdiction, ranging from 100-1000 (particularly cool things get more, i.e. things that there are only one of in the level).

Treasure chests: The L1 simple chest should have 200-499 points attached. The L1 fancy chest should have 500-800 points attached. The L3 (now Part 2) simple chest should have 400-699 points attached, and the L3/Part 2 fancy chest should have 700-1000 points attached.

DON'T be afraid to give the player more treasure than you think is necessary. Big Numbers Feel Good.

If you have ANY questions please ask Jess on facebook (Jess South) or text her at 812-550-0810 for fastest response time.
