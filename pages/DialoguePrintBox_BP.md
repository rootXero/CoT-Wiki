# Usage

This will spawn a box volume, which should be scaled to cover a broad enough area that the player cannot accidentally jump over or walk around them.

Each dialogue print will only trigger once per play.

# Variables

| Variable |    
|---|---|
| Dialogue           | The text the chosen character should say in this spot, with punctuation but without quotation marks around it.                                                     |
| Dialogue Duration  | The number of seconds this dialogue should display on screen for. While this is a slider, you can input numbers beyond the slider values if you need to by typing. |
| Character Speaking | Which character is speaking this dialogue                                                                                                                          |

# In the Future

This will eventually become the trigger box(es) for actual audio clips, and it will allow you to set multiple charactersâ€™ dialogue. Only if the character speaking overlaps this volume will they speak, so keep this in mind when planning later polish.
