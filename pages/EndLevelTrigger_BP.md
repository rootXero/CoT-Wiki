# Usage

Place over the final goal asset, slightly larger than said asset and at least half as tall as Ammon. This will trigger a print statement upon interaction.

# Variables

N/A

# In the Future

This volume will eventually trigger the cutscene to move to the next level. If you need this to trigger on character overlap like DialoguePrintBox_BP instead of on interaction, message me and I can give you a dropdown choice to do so.
