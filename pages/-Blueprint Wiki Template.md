This is only a bare-bones template. If you have questions, I recommend looking at existing pages on this wiki for examples. This wiki uses Markdown formattingâ€”if you aren't familiar with it, check the bottom right of the editing pane for the "Syntax" link for explanation.

# Summary

A brief summary of what this Blueprint is, what it does, and any important notes the level designers should know about how it functions.

# Usage

Explain how to use this Blueprint, especially any special instructions if multiple pieces are needed or if there are things that need to be set in the Details panel that aren't immediately obvious (static meshes are a common culprit).

# Variables

A table of all the publicly editable variables in this Blueprint, organized under the correct category names and ordered as they are in the Details pane. Explain in as much detail as possible what they do and any relevant data needed to use them properly, and include the number of the SVN revision in which each variable was introduced or updated.

Use bold, ALLCAPS subheaders for category names between variables.

I recommend using a site like http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables to generate these tables, as it's faster than typing out the code yourself.

Example: 

| Name         | Details                                                                                       | Revision No. |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
|              | **CATEGORY NAME**                                                                             |              |
| VariableName | Detailed explanation of the variable, including all relevant information and important notes. | ###          |

# In the Future

Explain anything that you plan to do with this Blueprint in the future that is relevant for level designers to know. This includes any major changes that may occur, especially if they may break functionality (changing an object to an array, for instance) or otherwise change functionality.
