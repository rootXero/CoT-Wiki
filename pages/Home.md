# Welcome

Welcome to your Wiki!

You can start by editing this page or by creating a new page.

Use the editor to edit page contents. All pages support Markdown formatting, below are some examples to get you started. You can always view the "Syntax" link in the editor for quick reference.

## Markdown examples

Some of the examples below are wrapped in code-blocks. Remove the backticks (`) around the examples to Preview them.

### Headers

````
 # H1
 ## H2
 ### H3
 #### H4
 ##### H5
 ###### H6
````

Note that the page's Table of Contents are automatically generated from headings H1 to H6 prefixed with the hashtag sign(s).
In order for the Table of Contents to work properly, use hashtag notation and nest the headings properly.

### Text Styles

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~A terrible mistake.~~


### Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  1. Ordered sub-list item
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list item
4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.


* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
  + Undordered sub-list item

### Links

```

### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline code:
````
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

````

Code blocks:

```
<p>Hello world</p>
<p>Let's throw in a <b>tag</b></p>
```

### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Awesome  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| --------:|
| Row 1         | Text          | Some     |
| Row 2         | Text          | Content  |
| Row 3         | **Bold Text** | Here     |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.  
> This line is part of the same quote.

### Horizontal Rule

### Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by a newline, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...  
This line is only separated by two trailing spaces, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
