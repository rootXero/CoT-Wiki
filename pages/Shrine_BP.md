# Usage

Drag and drop the shrine into your level, and position it where you like. Shrines allow a player to interact with them, at which point their spawn point will be changed to reflect the shrine's current location as a sort of soft-save.

# Variables

At present there are none that should be set. Shrines will funtion properly without any fiddling.

# In the Future

Each shrine will eventually have an associated cost to use, and open HUD-based options when interacted with. Functionality will differ depending on level design and time availible to polish the game. Spawn rotation will also be set to always face the shrine, unless we decide that it's better to face the player along their path.
